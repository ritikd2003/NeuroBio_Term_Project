## NeuroBio Term Project – Hodgkin–Huxley Model

This repository contains the materials developed as part of a **Neurobiology term project** during sem 07, focused on the **Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model** of neuronal action potentials and its application to understanding **neuromuscular disorders**.

Using the Hodgkin–Huxley framework, the project also explores the physiological basis of **Myotonia** and **Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis**, illustrating how alterations in ion channel dynamics can lead to pathological excitability.

### Repository Structure

**Presentation/**
- `HH_model_ppt.pdf`  
  Presentation introducing the Hodgkin–Huxley model, its biological basis, and mathematical formulation, along with disease-related insights.

**Report/**
- `HH_brief_report.pdf`  
  A concise report summarizing the model, assumptions, and key results.
- `HH_model.pdf`  
  The final detailed report including theory, equations, simulations, and discussion of disease mechanisms.

**codes/**
- `HH_model.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook implementing the full Hodgkin–Huxley model to simulate neuronal action potentials.
- `HH (RC only) simple model.ipynb`  
  A simplified RC-circuit–based neuron model used for comparison and conceptual understanding.

This repository serves as an academic record of the theoretical study and computational simulations carried out for the term project.
